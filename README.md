# knockout-phonecat

This is a version of the Angular Phonecat training app that is implemented using Knockout JS. Run it on an http server.

Working so far:

* List view, with list component and filtering
* Details view component
* Cross-component interaction
* AJAX calls
* ko.mapping


ToDo
* Clean-up/remove view models (use ko.mapping for list view)
* Sorting
* Investigate a solution for hashbang urls or history
* Use a module loader to allow component markup to live in separate files
